From Pixels to Predictions: A Comparative Study of CRF and Auto-context CRF Models Under  Varying Sliding Window Contexts

This project investigates how contextual information impacts the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using structured prediction models. Specifically, it compares a baseline Conditional Random Field (CRF) model with an Auto-context CRF model across varying context window sizes and dataset splits.
